== DESCRIPTION:

pymmseg-cpp is a Python interface to rmmseg-cpp. rmmseg-cpp is a high
performance Chinese word segmentation utility for Ruby. However, the
core part is written in C++ independent of Ruby. So I decide to write
a Python interface for it in order to use it in my Python project.

== FEATURES:

* Runs fast and the memory consumption is small.

* Support user customized dictionaries.

* UTF-8 and Unicode encoding is supported.

== SYNOPSIS:

=== A simple script

pymmseg-cpp provides a simple script (bin/pymmseg), which can read the
text from standard input and print the segmented result to standard
output. Try pymmseg -h for help on the options.

=== As a Python module

To use pymmseg-cpp in normal Python program, first import the module and
init by loading the dictionaries:

  from pymmseg import mmseg

  mmseg.Dictionary.load_dictionaries()

If you want to load your own customized dictionaries, please customize
``mmseg.Dictionary.dictionaries`` before calling load_dictionaries.

Then create an Algorithm iterable object and iterate through it:

  algor = mmseg.Algorithm(text)
  for tok in algor:
      print '%s [%d..%d]' % (tok.text, tok.start, tok.end)

=== Customize the dictionary

You can also load your own character dictionary or word dictionary in the
following way:

  from pymmseg import mmseg

  mmseg.dict_load_words('customize_words.dic')
  mmseg.dict_load_chars('customize_chars.dic')

==== Format for chars.dic

* each line contains the freq of the character, a space, and then the character

==== Format for words.dic

* each line contains the length of the word, a space, and then the word

==== WARNING

* The length of the word means number of characters in the word, not number of bytes
* The format of words.dic is different from chars.dic, see above
* There should be a newline at the end of all the dict file

== REQUIREMENTS:

* python 2.5
* g++

== INSTALLATION:

pymmseg-cpp should be installed using pip or setuptools:

  pip install pymmseg-cpp

  easy_install pymmseg-cpp

Download the package at
http://code.google.com/p/pymmseg-cpp/downloads/list. If you download
the source tarball, you'll need to compile it by using:

  python setup.py build

if you download the pre-compiled version, this step can be skipped.
Then copy the pymmseg directory to your Python's package path. e.g.
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ . Now you can use pymmseg in your
application.
